**Configuration:**
```python
class ResearchInstructions(BaseModel):
    detailed_prompt: str
    target_model: str = "o3-deep-research-2025-06-26"
```

### 4. PRISMA Pipeline (`src/prisma_pipeline.py`)

**Changes Made:**
- Updated search configuration model from `"o3-deep-research"` to `"o3-deep-research-2025-06-26"`
- Updated PRISMA writer agent model from `"o3"` to `"o3-deep-research-2025-06-26"`
- Updated writer configuration model to use `"o3-deep-research-2025-06-26"`

**Configuration:**
```python
# Search Agent Configuration
search_cfg = RunConfig(model="o3-deep-research-2025-06-26", tracing_disabled=True)

# Writer Agent Configuration
return Agent(
    name="PRISMA Writer",
    model="o3-deep-research-2025-06-26",
    instructions=instructions,
)

# Writer Runtime Configuration
writer_cfg = RunConfig(model="o3-deep-research-2025-06-26", tracing_disabled=True)
```
