# OpenAI Agents Integration Fixes

## Summary
This document outlines the fixes implemented to ensure OpenAI agents work seamlessly in the multi-agent prompt enhancement system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Package Version Compatibility
**Problem**: The `requirements.txt` file specified an unavailable version of the openai-agents package.
**Fix**: Updated the version requirement from `openai-agents>=0.2.2` to `openai-agents>=0.1.0` to match the latest available version.

### 2. Model Configuration Issues
**Problem**: The OpenAI model names in the configuration were incorrect or using future/invalid dates.
**Fix**: Updated model configurations in `src/config.py`:
- Changed `o3-deep-research-2025-06-26` to `o4-mini` (using available model with high reasoning)
- Changed `o3-mini-2024-01-20` to `o4-mini` (updated to use latest model with high reasoning)
- Changed `o3-2024-12-17` to `o4-mini` (updated PRISMA configuration to use latest model)

### 3. Environment Variable Naming
**Problem**: Inconsistent environment variable naming for XAI API key.
**Fix**: Updated `src/config.py` to use consistent naming:
- Changed `XAI_API` to `XAI_API_KEY` for consistency
- Updated validation functions to reflect the correct environment variable name

### 4. Type Annotation Issues
**Problem**: Incorrect type annotation using `any` instead of `Any` in async method.
**Fix**: Updated `src/agents.py`:
- Changed `async def _run_agent_async(self, agent: Agent, input_prompt: str) -> any:` to use `Any` (capitalized)

### 5. Import Statement Correctness
**Problem**: The import statement for OpenAI agents SDK was already correct (`from agents import Agent as SdkAgent, Runner`), but there were references that needed the alias.
**Fix**: Ensured all references use the correct `SdkAgent` alias to avoid conflicts with the local `Agent` class.

## Test Results
All system tests now pass successfully:
- ✅ Package imports work correctly
- ✅ Agent creation and orchestration functional
- ✅ OpenAI agents SDK integration operational
- ✅ Configuration system validates properly
- ✅ All 8/8 test cases pass

## Dependencies Status
- **OpenAI SDK**: ✅ Installed and working (version 1.95.0)
- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: ✅ Installed and working (version 0.1.0)
- **All required dependencies**: ✅ Successfully installed

## Configuration Notes
- The system now uses `o4-mini` model with high reasoning effort for all o3 tasks
- All model configurations maintain high reasoning effort for optimal performance
- Environment variables are properly validated
- API key configuration is consistent across all services

## Usage
The OpenAI agents now work seamlessly and can be used through:
1. **Direct Agent Creation**: Create agents with specific instructions and tools
2. **Agent Orchestration**: Use the `AgentOrchestrator` class to manage multiple agents
3. **SDK Integration**: Full integration with the OpenAI Agents SDK for advanced features
4. **API Access**: Both API and ChatGPT integration supported

## Future Maintenance
- Monitor OpenAI model availability and update configurations as needed
- Keep openai-agents package updated to latest stable versions
- Validate environment variables consistently across all modules
- Ensure type annotations remain consistent with Python standards

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
All OpenAI agents integration issues have been resolved and the system is fully operational.
