# Advanced Aeromedical Evidence Review System

A multi-agent AI framework for aeromedical research, systematic reviews, and risk assessments.

## Key Features

- **üî¨ Multi-Agent Architecture**: Uses multiple AI agents to perform complex research tasks.
- **üìä PRISMA Systematic Reviews**: Automatically generates PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic reviews.
- **üéØ Smart Mode Detection**: Analyzes your question to select the best AI agent for the job.
- **üåê Specialized Knowledge**: Integrates with medical and aerospace knowledge bases.
- **üìù Professional Export**: Exports conversations and research to clean Markdown files.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd textappv2
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API keys. At a minimum, you need an `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

    ```env
    # Required for core functionality
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"

    # Required for the PRISMA systematic review feature
    PPLX_API_KEY="your_perplexity_api_key_here"
    XAI_API_KEY="your_grok_xai_api_key_here"
    
    # Required for specialized medical knowledge bases
    FLOWISE_API_KEY="your_flowise_api_key_here"
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## How to Use

### Quick Start

Simply start the application and ask your question. The system will automatically choose the best mode to answer it.

```
$ python src/main.py
üéØ Ask your question (auto-detection enabled)
>>> What are the effects of hypoxia on pilot performance?
```

### Commands
