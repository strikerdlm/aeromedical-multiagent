"""A simple mode manager used to switch between different operating modes of the
application.

The implementation is intentionally lightweight – it only provides the minimal
behaviour that is required by the test-suite that accompanies this repository.
Nevertheless, the public interface is generic enough so it can be easily
extended in the future without breaking the existing contract.

class ModeManager:  # pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
    """Utility class that keeps track of the currently active *mode* and the
    *agent* that should be used to service the user request in that mode.

    Parameters
    ----------
    app:
        A reference to the main application instance.  The object **must**
        expose at least the following attributes that are used by the
        *ModeManager* implementation:

        * ``console`` – an object exposing a ``print`` method that is used to
          emit rich-formatted messages to the terminal.
        * ``prompt_agents`` – the agent (or agent container) that should be
          used when operating in *prompt* mode.
        * ``flowise_agents`` – a :class:`dict` mapping specific Flowise modes
          (``deep_research``, ``aeromedical_risk``, ``aerospace_medicine_rag``)
          to their corresponding agents.
        * ``prisma_system`` – the agent that performs PRISMA systematic
          reviews.
        * ``user_preferences`` – a mapping that contains user-defined
          preferences.  Only ``auto_suggest`` and ``confirm_mode_switch`` are
          accessed by the manager.

    Notes
    -----
    The manager starts in the special *smart* mode.  When in *smart* mode the
    :meth:`handle_smart_mode_detection` helper can be used to automatically
    deduce the optimal mode for a user query and seamlessly switch to it.
