# Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the bugs that were identified and fixed in the codebase.

## üîß Major Infrastructure Fixes

### 1. Missing Python Command
**Problem**: The `python` command was not available, causing all Python scripts to fail.
**Solution**: Created a symlink from `python3` to `python` using:
```bash
sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
```

### 2. Missing Python Virtual Environment Support
**Problem**: Could not create virtual environments due to missing `python3-venv` package.
**Solution**: Installed required system packages:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3.13-venv python3-pip
```

### 3. Missing Python Dependencies
**Problem**: All required Python packages were missing, causing `ModuleNotFoundError` for essential libraries like `rich`, `openai`, `requests`, etc.
**Solution**: Created a virtual environment and installed all dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üêõ Code Quality Fixes

### 4. Bare `except:` Clauses (Critical Bug)
**Problem**: Multiple files contained bare `except:` clauses which catch all exceptions including system exits and keyboard interrupts, making debugging difficult and potentially masking critical errors.

**Files Fixed**:
- `network_scan.py` (4 occurrences)
- `test_live_apis.py` (1 occurrence)
- `src/perplexity_client.py` (2 occurrences)

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced `except:` with specific exception types like:
  - `except (subprocess.SubprocessError, subprocess.TimeoutExpired, OSError):`
  - `except (socket.herror, socket.gaierror, OSError):`
  - `except (ValueError, KeyError, TypeError):`
  - `except (socket.error, OSError):`

**Example Fix**:
```python
# Before (BAD):
try:
    result = subprocess.run(['ping', '-c', '1', str(ip)], capture_output=True)
    if result.returncode == 0:
        return str(ip)
except:
    pass

# After (GOOD):
try:
    result = subprocess.run(['ping', '-c', '1', str(ip)], capture_output=True)
    if result.returncode == 0:
        return str(ip)
except (subprocess.SubprocessError, subprocess.TimeoutExpired, OSError):
    pass
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified:
1. ‚úÖ Python environment works correctly
2. ‚úÖ All dependencies are installed
3. ‚úÖ Main application imports successfully
4. ‚úÖ No syntax errors in any Python files
5. ‚úÖ No remaining bare `except:` clauses
6. ‚úÖ Rich library and custom stubs work properly

## üéØ Impact

These fixes resolve:
- **Runtime crashes** due to missing dependencies
- **Poor error handling** that could hide critical issues
- **Development environment** setup problems
- **Import errors** throughout the application

The application should now run successfully with proper error handling and all dependencies available.
