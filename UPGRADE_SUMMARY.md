# Upgrade Summary: Grok-4 and Enhanced Model Support

## Overview

This upgrade adds support for the latest AI models, including **grok-4** and multiple Perplexity model options, with improved configuration flexibility.

## Key Changes

### 1. Model Configuration Updates

#### Grok Models
- **Default Model**: Changed from `grok-beta` to `grok-4`
- **Available Models**: 
  - grok-4 (latest, recommended)
  - grok-3
  - grok-3-beta
  - grok-beta (legacy)
  - grok-vision-beta

#### Perplexity Models
- **Default Model**: Remains `sonar-deep-research`
- **Available Models**:
  - sonar-deep-research (recommended for research)
  - sonar-pro
  - sonar-reasoning-pro
  - sonar

### 2. Configuration Flexibility

Models can now be configured via environment variables:
```bash
GROK_MODEL=grok-4
PERPLEXITY_MODEL=sonar-deep-research
```

### 3. Model Validation

Both Grok and Perplexity clients now validate model selection:
- Invalid models trigger a warning
- System falls back to default models
- Logging provides visibility into model selection

### 4. Files Modified

1. **src/config.py**
   - Added `GROK_AVAILABLE_MODELS` list
   - Added `PERPLEXITY_AVAILABLE_MODELS` list
   - Made model selection configurable via environment variables

2. **src/grok_client.py**
   - Added model validation
   - Added logging for model initialization

3. **src/perplexity_client.py**
   - Added model validation
   - Added logging for model initialization

4. **test_live_apis.py**
   - Updated to use grok-4
   - Made model selection dynamic

5. **validate_api_structure.py**
   - Updated to use grok-4

6. **API_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md**
   - Added model configuration documentation
   - Listed available models for both services

7. **MODEL_SUPPORT.md** (new)
   - Comprehensive documentation of supported models
   - Model selection guidelines
   - Migration instructions

## Benefits

1. **Latest Capabilities**: Access to grok-4's superior reasoning and 256K context window
2. **Flexibility**: Easy switching between models based on use case
3. **Cost Optimization**: Choose models based on performance/cost tradeoffs
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new models as they become available
5. **Better Documentation**: Clear guidance on model selection

## Migration Guide

To upgrade existing installations:

1. Update your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   GROK_MODEL=grok-4
   PERPLEXITY_MODEL=sonar-deep-research
   ```

2. Verify API keys are set:
   ```bash
   XAI_API_KEY=your_actual_xai_key
   PPLX_API_KEY=your_actual_perplexity_key
   ```

3. Test the configuration:
   ```bash
   python3 test_live_apis.py
   ```

## Notes

- The system maintains backward compatibility with `grok-beta`
- Invalid model names automatically fall back to defaults
- All changes are non-breaking for existing deployments
